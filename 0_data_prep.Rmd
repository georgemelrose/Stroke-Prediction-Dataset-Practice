### Removing Blood Glucose Variable

The average glucose level variable can be considered redundant or less
informative for exploratory data analysis (EDA) without additional
context about when the readings were taken.

Glucose levels can fluctuate significantly based on factors such as
fasting status, recent meals, and time of day. For example, a reading
taken shortly after eating will typically be higher than a fasting
reading -

```{r blood glucose chart,  fig.cap="Blood Glucose Chart from 'Lark Health' "}
knitr::include_graphics("BloodGlucoseChart.jpeg")
```

Without knowing the conditions under which the glucose levels were
measured, it becomes difficult to draw meaningful conclusions or
identify trends during EDA. A reading labeled as "normal" may not
actually reflect the patient’s metabolic health.

```{r removing glucose level variable from dataset and looking at data types of dataset}
stroke_data <- stroke_data %>% select(-avg_glucose_level)

str(stroke_data)

datatable(stroke_data[1:10, ],options = list(scrollX = TRUE))
```



```{r split data into test and train}
set.seed(1234)


stroke_split <- initial_split(stroke_data, prop = 0.8)
# train_data
stroke_training <- training(stroke_split)
# test_data
stroke_testing <- testing(stroke_split)
```

### Handling Missingness

#### Missingness in the whole original Stroke dataset

```{r checking missingness again after making variables numeric}
ff_glimpse(stroke_data)
```

```{r checking missingness in the bmi category variable }
# Check how many NAs are in the categorical variable and inspect its unique values
na_categorical_count <- sum(is.na(stroke_data$bmi_category))
cat("Number of NAs in categorical BMI variable:", na_categorical_count, "\n")

# View unique BMI category values
unique(stroke_data$bmi_category)
```

There are 181 NAs in the original 'bmi' variable. These didn't show up
in the first usage of ff_glimpse() as the variable was a *character*
type, so N/A and a numeric value were treated the same. A second usage
of ff_glimpse() shows the 181 NAs, which of course are then carried on
to the categorical variable when that is made.

```{r missing values plot}
explanatory <- c("bmi","gender","age","hypertension_yn","heart_disease_yn","ever_married",
                 "work_type","residence_type","smoking_status","age_category")
dependent <- "stroke_yn"

 stroke_data %>% 
  missing_plot(dependent, explanatory, title = "Missingness for the whole dataset")

 
```

There are different types of missingness:

-   **MCAR (Missing Completely at Random)** - "Missing data values do
    not relate to any other data in the dataset and there is no pattern
    to the actual values of the missing data themselves."

-   **MAR (Missing at Random)** - "This is confusing and would be better
    named *missing conditionally at random*. Here, missingness in a
    particular variable has an association with one or more other
    variables in the dataset. However, the actual values of the missing
    data are random."

-   **MNAR (Missing not at random)** - "The pattern of missingness is
    related to other variables in the dataset, but in addition, *the
    actual values of the missing data are not random*."

Fo example, in a different dataset, smoking status would be missing in
females more likely to smoke but not in males.

"Thus, the complete case female patients have different characteristics
to the missing data female patients. For instance, the missing data
female patients may be more likely to die after cancer treatment.
Looking at our available population, ***we therefore under estimate the
likelihood of a female dying from cancer treatment***."

"In deciding whether data is MCAR or MAR, one approach is to explore
patterns of missingness between levels of included variables. This is
particularly important...for a primary outcome measure / dependent
variable.

Take for example “death”. When that outcome is missing it is often for a
particular reason. For example, perhaps patients undergoing emergency
surgery were less likely to have complete records compared with those
undergoing planned surgery. And of course, death is more likely after
emergency surgery."

```{r looking for patterns of missingness}

stroke_data %>% 
  missing_pattern(dependent, explanatory)

```

##### BMI

```{r checking for associations between missing and observed data part 1 bmi}
explanatory <- c("bmi","gender","hypertension_yn","ever_married")
dependent <- "stroke_yn"

stroke_data %>% 
  missing_pairs(dependent, explanatory, position = "fill")

```

```{r checking for associations between missing and observed data part 2 bmi}
explanatory <- c("bmi","work_type","residence_type","smoking_status")
dependent <- "stroke_yn"

stroke_data %>% 
  missing_pairs(dependent, explanatory, position = "fill")

```

```{r checking for associations between missing and observed data part 3 bmi}
explanatory <- c("bmi","heart_disease_yn","age")
dependent <- "stroke_yn"

stroke_data %>% 
  missing_pairs(dependent, explanatory, position = "fill")

```

Looking at the above 3 plots, the following can be observed:

-   There is more missingness for the BMI variable in those patients who
    have stroke than those who do not.

-   There is also slightly more missingness in those with hypertension
    than those patients without it.

-   In those patients with heart disease and an average older patients ,
    there is also more BMI missingness.

-   Given the above info., we can conclude that the BMI variable
    missingness is MAR - *missingness in a particular variable that has
    an association with one or more other variables in the dataset*.

The relevant variables that have an association with missingness in bmi
are selected for a single missing pairs plot below.

```{r generating a missing pairs plot of associated variables strokeyn heartdisease hypertension age}

explanatory <- c("bmi","heart_disease_yn","hypertension_yn","age")
dependent <- "stroke_yn"

stroke_data %>% 
  missing_pairs(dependent, explanatory, position = "fill", title = "Missing Data Matrix - BMI")

```

##### Smoking Status

```{r checking for associations between missing and observed data part 1 smoking}
explanatory <- c("smoking_status", "bmi","gender","hypertension_yn")
dependent <- "stroke_yn"

stroke_data %>% 
  missing_pairs(dependent, explanatory, position = "fill")

```

```{r checking for associations between missing and observed data part 2 smoking}
explanatory <- c("smoking_status","work_type","residence_type","heart_disease_yn", "age")
dependent <- "stroke_yn"

stroke_data %>% 
  missing_pairs(dependent, explanatory, position = "fill")

```

Looking at the 2 above plots, the following can be seen:

-   There is more missingness for the smoking_status variable in those
    patients who do not have hypertension than those who do.

-   There is significant difference in smoking_status missingness across
    'Work Type'.

-   Given the above, we can conclude that the smoking_status variable
    missingness is also MAR.

The relevant variables that have an association with missingness in
smoking_status are selected for a single missing pairs plot below.

```{r generating a missing pairs plot of associated variables}

explanatory <- c("smoking_status","hypertension_yn","work_type")
dependent <- "stroke_yn"

stroke_data %>% 
  missing_pairs(dependent, explanatory, position = "fill",title = "Missing Data Matrix - smoking_status")


```

```{r generating necessary factor variables}

#gender#
stroke_data$gender <- as.factor(stroke_data$gender)

summary(stroke_data$gender)

#ever_married#

stroke_data$ever_married <- as.factor(stroke_data$ever_married)

summary(stroke_data$ever_married)

#work_type#
stroke_data$work_type <- as.factor(stroke_data$work_type)

summary(stroke_data$work_type)

#residence_type#
stroke_data$residence_type <- as.factor(stroke_data$residence_type)

summary(stroke_data$residence_type)

#smoking_status#
stroke_data$smoking_status <- as.factor(stroke_data$smoking_status)

summary(stroke_data$smoking_status)

```

In the gender and work_type variables there are factor levels with
minuscule values - 'Other' in gender with 1 and 'Never_worked' in
work_type with 5. These numbers are extremely small and likely to
disturb further analysis so I'll make them NA so as to not lose the
patients but not have the awkward category either.

```{r making nas from and dropping factor levels with too little in them}

stroke_data$gender[stroke_data$gender == "Other"] <- NA

stroke_data$work_type[stroke_data$work_type == "Never_worked"] <- NA

stroke_data$gender <- droplevels(stroke_data$gender)

stroke_data$work_type <- droplevels(stroke_data$work_type)


summary(stroke_data$gender)

summary(stroke_data$work_type)

```

#### Missingness in the training Stroke dataset

To avoid data leakage, imputation shall have to be done on the
respective stroke training and testing datasets rather than the whole
'stroke_data' dataframe. Data leakage happens when information from the
test set influences the training process, leading to overly optimistic
performance estimates.If imputation happens before splitting, the
imputer learns from the entire dataset, including the test set, which
can introduce bias.

This ensures that the test set remains unseen during training,
preserving the integrity of model evaluation. To be pedantic, the above plots 
code visualising missingness for all the dataframe and for the variables 
showing missingness is run again for training data in this section. Testing data
missingness and subsequent MICE is covered in the next section. 


```{r missing values plot for training data}
explanatory <- c("bmi","gender","age","hypertension_yn","heart_disease_yn","ever_married",
                 "work_type","residence_type","smoking_status","age_category")
dependent <- "stroke_yn"

 stroke_training %>% 
  missing_plot(dependent, explanatory, title = "Missingness for Training Data")
 
```


```{r looking for patterns of missingness in the training data}

stroke_training %>% 
  missing_pattern(dependent, explanatory)

```


##### BMI

```{r checking for associations between missing and observed training data part 1 bmi}
explanatory <- c("bmi","gender","hypertension_yn","ever_married")
dependent <- "stroke_yn"

stroke_training  %>% 
  missing_pairs(dependent, explanatory, position = "fill")

```

```{r checking for associations between missing and observed training data part 2 bmi}
explanatory <- c("bmi","work_type","residence_type","smoking_status")
dependent <- "stroke_yn"

stroke_training %>% 
  missing_pairs(dependent, explanatory, position = "fill")


```

```{r checking for associations between missing and observed training data part 3 bmi}
explanatory <- c("bmi","heart_disease_yn","age")
dependent <- "stroke_yn"

stroke_training %>% 
  missing_pairs(dependent, explanatory, position = "fill")

```


The above 3 plots for the stroke training data have the same patterns as for the
whole 'stroke_data' dataset:

-   More missingness for the BMI variable in those patients who have stroke than
    those who do not.

-   Slightly more missingness in those with hypertension than those patients 
    without it.

-   In those patients with heart disease and on average older patients ,
    there is also more BMI missingness.

-   MAR for stroke_training.

Again, the relevant variables that have an association with missingness in bmi
are selected for a single missing pairs plot.


```{r generating a missing pairs plot of associated variables strokeyn heartdisease hypertension age in training data}

explanatory <- c("bmi","heart_disease_yn","hypertension_yn","age")
dependent <- "stroke_yn"

stroke_training %>% 
  missing_pairs(dependent, explanatory, position = "fill", title = "Missing Data Matrix - BMI")

```

##### Smoking Status

```{r checking for associations between missing and observed data part 1 smoking in training data}
explanatory <- c("smoking_status", "bmi","gender","hypertension_yn")
dependent <- "stroke_yn"

stroke_training %>% 
  missing_pairs(dependent, explanatory, position = "fill")

```

```{r checking for associations between missing and observed data part 2 smoking in training data}
explanatory <- c("smoking_status","work_type","residence_type","heart_disease_yn", "age")
dependent <- "stroke_yn"

stroke_data %>% 
  missing_pairs(dependent, explanatory, position = "fill")

```


Looking at the 2 above plots, we can observe the following for the training data:

    
-   There is more missingness for the smoking_status variable in those
    patients who don't have hypertension than those who do.

-   There is significant difference in smoking_status missingness across
    'Work Type'.

-   Given the above, we can conclude that the smoking_status variable
    missingness is also MAR.

A single missing pairs plot below is made of the most relevant variables.


```{r generating a missing pairs plot of associated variables in training data smoking status}

explanatory <- c("smoking_status","hypertension_yn","work_type")
dependent <- "stroke_yn"

stroke_training %>% 
  missing_pairs(dependent, explanatory, position = "fill",title = "Missing Data Matrix - smoking_status")


```


#### MICE on training data MAR BMI & Smoking Status

Multivariate Imputation by Chained Equations (mice) is "*...the process
of filling in missing data using a best-estimate from all the other data
that exists.*" (Section 11.8.1 of the HealthyR book)

If missingness in BMI is predicted strongly by stroke outcome (and other
observed variables), and the values of the missing data are random, then
we can impute (best-guess) the missing BMI values using those variables.

"*Imputation is not usually appropriate for the explanatory variable of
interest or the outcome variable, although these can be used to impute
other variables. In both cases, the hypothesis is that there is a
meaningful association with other variables in the dataset, therefore it
doesn’t make sense to use these variables to impute them.*"

The multiple imputation process is as follows:

-   **Impute** missing data *m* times, resulting in *m* complete
    datasets.

-   **Diagnose** the quality of the impute values.

-   **Analyse** each completed dataset.

-   **Pool** the results of the reported analyses.


#### Impute

```{r choosing variables to be imputed and be used in imputation }

explanatory <- c("id","bmi","gender","age","hypertension_yn","heart_disease_yn","ever_married",
                 "work_type","residence_type","smoking_status")
dependent <- "stroke_yn"

#Choosing variables to not be imputed but still used by the mice function# 
stroke_training %>% 
  select(dependent, explanatory) %>% 
  missing_predictorMatrix(
    drop_from_imputed = c("gender","age","hypertension_yn","heart_disease_yn","ever_married",
                 "work_type","residence_type","stroke_yn","id"),
    drop_from_imputer = c("gender", "ever_married", "residence_type", "id")
  ) -> predM

```

```{r make 10 imputed datasets and run our logistic regression analysis on each set }
fits <- stroke_training %>% 
  select(dependent, explanatory) %>% 
  
  # Run imputation with 10 imputed sets
  mice(m = 10, predictorMatrix = predM) %>% 
  
  # Run logistic regression on each imputed set
  with(glm(formula(ff_formula(dependent, explanatory)), 
           family="binomial"))
```


#### Diagnose

```{r extracting aics}
# Examples of extracting metrics from fits and taking the mean
## AICs
fits %>% 
  getfit() %>% 
  purrr::map(AIC) %>%
  unlist() %>% 
  mean()
```

```{r obtaining the c statistic}
# C-statistic
fits %>% 
  getfit() %>% 
  purrr::map(~ pROC::roc(.x$y, .x$fitted)$auc) %>% 
  unlist() %>% 
  mean()
```

#### Analyse

```{r pool the results of the model and visualise in an or plot}
# Pool results
fits_pool <- fits %>% 
  pool()

## Can be passed to or_plot
stroke_training %>% 
  or_plot(dependent, explanatory, glmfit = fits_pool, table_text_size=4)
```

#### Pool

```{r summarise log reg models that do not have and have imputed bmi}
# Summarise and put in table
fit_imputed <- fits_pool %>%                                  
  fit2df(estimate_name = "OR (multiple imputation)", exp = TRUE)

# Use finalfit merge methods to create and compare results
explanatory <- c("bmi","gender","age","hypertension_yn","heart_disease_yn","ever_married","work_type","residence_type","smoking_status")

table_uni_multi <- stroke_training %>% 
  finalfit(dependent, explanatory, keep_fit_id = TRUE) 

explanatory = c("gender","age","hypertension_yn","heart_disease_yn","ever_married","work_type","residence_type","smoking_status")

fit_multi_no_bmi <- stroke_training %>% 
  glmmulti(dependent, explanatory) %>% 
  fit2df(estimate_suffix = " (multivariable without BMI)") 

# Combine to final table
table_imputed <- 
  table_uni_multi %>% 
  ff_merge(fit_multi_no_bmi) %>% 
  ff_merge(fit_imputed, last_merge = TRUE)

table_imputed 
```

```{r summarise log reg models that do not have and have imputed smoking status}
# Summarise and put in table
fit_imputed <- fits_pool %>%                                  
  fit2df(estimate_name = "OR (multiple imputation)", exp = TRUE)

# Use finalfit merge methods to create and compare results
explanatory <- c("bmi","gender","age","hypertension_yn","heart_disease_yn","ever_married","work_type","residence_type","smoking_status")

table_uni_multi <- stroke_training %>% 
  finalfit(dependent, explanatory, keep_fit_id = TRUE) 

explanatory = c("bmi","gender","age","hypertension_yn","heart_disease_yn","ever_married","work_type","residence_type")

fit_multi_no_smoking_status <- stroke_training %>% 
  glmmulti(dependent, explanatory) %>% 
  fit2df(estimate_suffix = " (multivariable without Smoking Status)") 

# Combine to final table
table_imputed <- 
  table_uni_multi %>% 
  ff_merge(fit_multi_no_smoking_status) %>% 
  ff_merge(fit_imputed, last_merge = TRUE)

table_imputed 
```


#### Generating Data & Adding Imputed Values to stroke_training 

```{r doing mice again to save and extract the data}
explanatory <- c("id","bmi","gender","age","hypertension_yn","heart_disease_yn","ever_married",
                 "work_type","residence_type","smoking_status")
dependent <- "stroke_yn"

stroke_training %>% 
  select(dependent, explanatory) %>% 
  missing_predictorMatrix(
  drop_from_imputed = c("gender","age","hypertension_yn","heart_disease_yn","ever_married",
                 "work_type","residence_type","stroke_yn","id"),
    drop_from_imputer = c("gender","ever_married","residence_type","id")
  ) -> predM

fits <- stroke_training %>%
select(dependent, explanatory) %>%
mice(m = 10, predictorMatrix = predM)


completedData <- complete(fits, action = 1)
```


```{r scatterplot of original and imputed data bmi vs age}
#scatter plot of original and imputed data with the magenta points being the imputed data points and the blue points being the observed values#

xyplot(fits,bmi ~ age,pch=18,cex=1)

```

```{r density plot of observed and imputed values for smoking status}
# Convert your factor variable to a factor with appropriate levels
fits$data$smoking_status <- factor(fits$data$smoking_status)

# Now, create the density plot again with factor levels on the x-axis
densityplot(fits, 
            ~ smoking_status,                     # Factor variable with levels
            main = "Density of Observed and Imputed Values for Smoking Status",
            xlab = "Smoking Status",               # Custom x-axis label
            scales = list(x = list(at = 1:length(levels(fits$data$smoking_status)), 
                                   labels = levels(fits$data$smoking_status))))
```

The above is a scatter plot of original and imputed data with the magenta points 
being the imputed data points and the blue points being the observed values. 
The matching shape is a good verification of the imputed values indeed being 
plausible.

```{r density plot of observed and imputed values for bmi}
densityplot(fits, 
            ~ bmi,                     # Factor variable with levels
            main = "Density of Observed and Imputed Values for BMI",
            xlab = "BMI")
```

The density of the imputed data for each imputed dataset is magenta and
the density of the observed data is blue. Again, we expect the
distributions to be similar.

```{r extracting id and bmi and limiting to just ids wo valid bmi}

ids_wo_bmi <- stroke_training %>% filter(is.na(bmi))

ids_wo_bmi <- ids_wo_bmi$id

imputed_bmi_values <- completedData %>% select(id, bmi)

imputed_bmi_values <- imputed_bmi_values %>% filter(id %in% ids_wo_bmi)
```

```{r adding imputed bmi values back to stroke data df}

stroke_training <- stroke_training %>%
  left_join(imputed_bmi_values, by = "id", suffix = c("", ".new")) %>%

  select(-bmi.new)
```

```{r extracting id and smoking status and limiting to just ids wo valid smoking status}

ids_wo_smoking_status <- stroke_training %>% filter(is.na(smoking_status))

ids_wo_smoking_status  <- ids_wo_smoking_status$id

```

  missing_plot(dependent, explanatory, title = "Missingness for Training Data")
 
```


```{r looking for patterns of missingness in the training data}

stroke_training %>% 
  missing_pattern(dependent, explanatory)

```


##### BMI

```{r checking for associations between missing and observed training data part 1 bmi}
explanatory <- c("bmi","gender","hypertension_yn","ever_married")
dependent <- "stroke_yn"

stroke_training  %>% 
  missing_pairs(dependent, explanatory, position = "fill")

```

```{r checking for associations between missing and observed training data part 2 bmi}
explanatory <- c("bmi","work_type","residence_type","smoking_status")
dependent <- "stroke_yn"

stroke_training %>% 
  missing_pairs(dependent, explanatory, position = "fill")


```

```{r checking for associations between missing and observed training data part 3 bmi}
explanatory <- c("bmi","heart_disease_yn","age")
dependent <- "stroke_yn"

stroke_training %>% 
  missing_pairs(dependent, explanatory, position = "fill")

```


The above 3 plots for the stroke training data have the same patterns as for the
whole 'stroke_data' dataset:

-   More missingness for the BMI variable in those patients who have stroke than
    those who do not.

-   Slightly more missingness in those with hypertension than those patients 
    without it.

-   In those patients with heart disease and on average older patients ,
    there is also more BMI missingness.

-   MAR for stroke_training.

Again, the relevant variables that have an association with missingness in bmi
are selected for a single missing pairs plot.


```{r generating a missing pairs plot of associated variables strokeyn heartdisease hypertension age in training data}

explanatory <- c("bmi","heart_disease_yn","hypertension_yn","age")
dependent <- "stroke_yn"

stroke_training %>% 
  missing_pairs(dependent, explanatory, position = "fill", title = "Missing Data Matrix - BMI")

```

##### Smoking Status

```{r checking for associations between missing and observed data part 1 smoking in training data}
explanatory <- c("smoking_status", "bmi","gender","hypertension_yn")
dependent <- "stroke_yn"

stroke_training %>% 
  missing_pairs(dependent, explanatory, position = "fill")

```

```{r checking for associations between missing and observed data part 2 smoking in training data}
explanatory <- c("smoking_status","work_type","residence_type","heart_disease_yn", "age")
dependent <- "stroke_yn"

stroke_data %>% 
  missing_pairs(dependent, explanatory, position = "fill")

```


Looking at the 2 above plots, we can observe the following for the training data:

    
-   There is more missingness for the smoking_status variable in those
    patients who don't have hypertension than those who do.

-   There is significant difference in smoking_status missingness across
    'Work Type'.

-   Given the above, we can conclude that the smoking_status variable
    missingness is also MAR.

A single missing pairs plot below is made of the most relevant variables.


```{r generating a missing pairs plot of associated variables in training data smoking status}

explanatory <- c("smoking_status","hypertension_yn","work_type")
dependent <- "stroke_yn"

stroke_training %>% 
  missing_pairs(dependent, explanatory, position = "fill",title = "Missing Data Matrix - smoking_status")


```





#### Missingness in the testing Stroke dataset


```{r missing values plot for testing data}

                 "work_type","residence_type","smoking_status","age_category")
dependent <- "stroke_yn"

 stroke_testing %>% 
  missing_plot(dependent, explanatory, title = "Missingness for testing Data")
 
```


```{r looking for patterns of missingness in the testing data}

```

```{r checking for associations between missing and observed testing data part 2 bmi}

```

```{r checking for associations between missing and observed testing data part 3 bmi}

    without it.

-   In those patients with heart disease and on average older patients ,
    there is also more BMI missingness.

-   MAR for stroke_testing.

Once more, the relevant variables that have an association with missingness in BMI
are selected for a single missing pairs plot.


```{r generating a missing pairs plot of associated variables strokeyn heartdisease hypertension age in testing data}

explanatory <- c("bmi","heart_disease_yn","hypertension_yn","age")

#### MICE on testing data MAR BMI & Smoking Status

```{r choosing variables to be imputed and be used in imputation }

  # Run logistic regression on each imputed set
  with(glm(formula(ff_formula(dependent, explanatory)), 
           family="binomial"))
```


#### Diagnose

```{r extracting aics}
# Examples of extracting metrics from fits and taking the mean

fit_imputed <- fits_pool %>%                                  
  fit2df(estimate_name = "OR (multiple imputation)", exp = TRUE)

# Use finalfit merge methods to create and compare results

table_imputed 
```

```{r summarise log reg models that do not have and have imputed smoking status}

#### Generating Data & Adding Imputed Values to stroke_testing 

```{r doing mice again to save and extract the data}

explanatory <- c("id","bmi","gender","age","hypertension_yn","heart_disease_yn","ever_married",
                 "work_type","residence_type","smoking_status")
dependent <- "stroke_yn"

stroke_testing %>% 
  select(dependent, explanatory) %>% 
  missing_predictorMatrix(
  drop_from_imputed = c("gender","age","hypertension_yn","heart_disease_yn","ever_married",
                 "work_type","residence_type","stroke_yn","id"),
    drop_from_imputer = c("gender","ever_married","residence_type","id")
  ) -> predM

fits <- stroke_testing %>%
select(dependent, explanatory) %>%
mice(m = 10, predictorMatrix = predM)


completedData <- complete(fits, action = 1)

```


```{r scatterplot of original and imputed data bmi vs age}
#scatter plot of original and imputed data with the magenta points being the imputed data points and the blue points being the observed values#

xyplot(fits,bmi ~ age,pch=18,cex=1)

```

```{r density plot of observed and imputed values for smoking status}
# Convert your factor variable to a factor with appropriate levels
fits$data$smoking_status <- factor(fits$data$smoking_status)

# Now, create the density plot again with factor levels on the x-axis
densityplot(fits, 
            ~ smoking_status,                     # Factor variable with levels
            main = "Density of Observed and Imputed Values for Smoking Status",
            xlab = "Smoking Status",               # Custom x-axis label
            scales = list(x = list(at = 1:length(levels(fits$data$smoking_status)), 
                                   labels = levels(fits$data$smoking_status))))
```

The above is a scatter plot of original and imputed data with the magenta points 
being the imputed data points and the blue points being the observed values. 
The matching shape is a good verification of the imputed values indeed being 
plausible.

```{r density plot of observed and imputed values for bmi}
densityplot(fits, 
            ~ bmi,                     # Factor variable with levels
            main = "Density of Observed and Imputed Values for BMI",
            xlab = "BMI")
```

The density of the imputed data for each imputed dataset is magenta and
the density of the observed data is blue. Again, we expect the
distributions to be similar.

```{r extracting id and bmi and limiting to just ids wo valid bmi}

ids_wo_bmi <- stroke_testing %>% filter(is.na(bmi))
